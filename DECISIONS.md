# Decision Log

Every architectural/environmental decision is recorded here with its rationale.
Format: `DEC-xxx | date | decision | rationale | alternatives rejected`.

## DEC-001 | 2026-09-07 | Virtual environment outside the repository
The venv lives at `%USERPROFILE%\sparkrl_env`, not `<repo>\.venv`.
**Rationale:** the repository sits in a OneDrive-synced folder (risk R9); thousands of
venv files under OneDrive cause sync churn and file locks. Activation is documented in
README.md. *Rejected alternative:* in-repo `.venv`.

## DEC-002 | 2026-09-07 | Bulk data root outside the repository
Datasets, Spark event logs, and Spark temp dirs default to `%USERPROFILE%\sparkrl_data`,
overridable via `SPARKRL_DATA_ROOT`. Resolution is implemented in
`src/sparkrl/utils/paths.py` (no absolute paths hard-coded in code).
**Rationale:** risk R9 (OneDrive interference with bulk IO); keeps the repo lightweight.
The repo `data/` subfolders remain as conventional placeholders (`.gitkeep`).

## DEC-003 | 2026-09-07 | PySpark pinned to 4.0.4
PyPI offers 4.0.0–4.2.0 and the 3.5.x line. Spark 4.0 officially supports Python 3.12 and
Java 17 — both present on this machine. The 4.0.x line is a mature patch series; 4.1/4.2
are newer minors with less ecosystem mileage. **Fallback** if the Day-2 smoke matrix fails
on Windows: Python 3.11 venv + `pyspark==3.5.x`, or WSL2 (per approved plan §39).

## DEC-004 | 2026-09-07 | Source layout: `src/sparkrl/` package
Maps the approved architecture (planning doc §28) onto the Day-1 instruction tree:
- `sparkrl.spark` + `sparkrl.workloads` + `sparkrl.datagen`  ↔ `src/spark/`
- `sparkrl.monitoring` ↔ `src/monitoring/`
- `sparkrl.env` (RL environment) ↔ `src/environment/`
- `sparkrl.agent` ↔ `src/rl/`
- `sparkrl.runner` + `sparkrl.analysis` ↔ `src/optimization/` + `src/evaluation/`
- `sparkrl.utils` ↔ `src/utils/`
Top-level `experiments/` holds the experiment registry and per-experiment YAML configs;
`configs/` holds cross-cutting configuration.

## DEC-005 | 2026-09-07 | Execution backend: native Windows local-mode (PROVISIONAL)
Priority chain: native Windows → WSL2 Ubuntu → Docker. Native Windows is chosen
provisionally (Java 17 + PySpark pip wheel present). Final confirmation happens in the
**Day-2 smoke-test matrix** (Parquet IO, event logs, winutils/Hadoop-native warnings).

## Open items
- Day 3: `docs/RESEARCH_PROBLEM.md` draft (was "Day 2" in earlier draft — superseded by Day-2 completion).

## DEC-006 | 2026-09-07 | Spark-on-Windows native-IO failure — empirical findings (Day 1)
**What was tested (all measured, see `docs/ENVIRONMENT_REPORT.md`):**
1. `pyspark==4.0.4` + Java 17, no HADOOP_HOME → SparkContext startup **hard-fails**
   (`Hadoop 3.4.x Shell.<clinit>` throws when `HADOOP_HOME` is unset on Windows).
2. Adding the winutils shim (cdarlint `hadoop-3.3.6`, `winutils.exe` + `hadoop.dll`) at
   `%USERPROFILE%\hadoop` made session startup, count jobs, aggregation, and event-log
   creation work — but Parquet **writes** still failed with
   `UnsatisfiedLinkError: NativeIO$Windows.access0`, because the 3.3.6 dll doesn't export
   the 3.4.x native symbol and `hadoop.dll` was not loadable from `PATH`.
3. Removing `hadoop.dll` (builtin-java fallback) did **not** bypass the commit-path call.
4. No Hadoop 3.4.x winutils builds exist in the community repos probed (cdarlint: 2.x–3.3.6
   only; kayrnt 3.4.x: 404), so Spark 4.0.4 / Hadoop 3.4.x on Windows is not viable here.

**Root cause of the remaining native-IO error (found Day 2):** `FileUtil.canRead →`
`NativeIO$Windows.access` requires the native `hadoop.dll` to actually load. On Day 1 both
`winutils.exe` and `hadoop.dll` were installed, but `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` was **never on
`PATH`**, so `System.loadLibrary("hadoop")` could never succeed and every native `access0`
call failed. **The fix is the standard Spark-on-Windows trio: `winutils.exe` + `hadoop.dll`
+ `PATH` entry.**

## DEC-007 | 2026-09-07 | Spark backend freeze — native Windows + PySpark 3.5.9
**Decision.** Backend = native Windows local mode: **Python 3.11.9** (per-user install,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python311`) + **pyspark==3.5.9** (Hadoop 3.3.4 client) +
**Java 17 Temurin** + **winutils 3.3.6 shim** (`winutils.exe` + `hadoop.dll`) at
`%USERPROFILE%\hadoop` with `HADOOP_HOME` and `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` on `PATH` (session +
User-persistent). `requirements.txt` re-pinned to the minimal core set
(pyspark 3.5.9, psutil, PyYAML, pytest); research extras moved to
`requirements-research.txt` (Day 13+).

**Evidence — full smoke matrix (A–K) PASS, 13/13:** SparkSession creation · DataFrame ·
count · aggregation · Parquet write/read/round-trip 1M (checksums exact) · event log
240 events / 0 bad lines, `SparkListenerLogStart`→`SparkListenerApplicationEnd` · clean
shutdown. `env_check.py`: OVERALL PASS, 14 checks, 0 failed, 0 warnings. Integration
tests: 2 passed. Backend benchmark (3 reps, deterministic 1M rows): medians
session_start 0.071 s· count 0.094 s· agg 0.29 s· parquet_write 0.427 s· parquet_read
0.152 s· shutdown 0.526 s· peak RSS 0.75–1.03 GB (rep 1 is cold-start). Event log is
**uncompressed JSON**; format documented.

**Alternatives considered:** (a) Spark 4.0.4 + 3.3.6 dll + PATH — dll has no 3.4.x exports
→ rejected (evidence Day 1); (b) builtin-java fallback — doesn't bypass commit path →
rejected; (c) WSL2 Ubuntu — distro not installed, installation delays 1–2 days, adds
platform skew vs the Windows-expectations of the viva → retained as fallback.

**Reason:** PySpark 3.5.9 (Hadoop 3.3.4 client) matches the community 3.3.6 shim within
the same minor line; this deliberately trades Spark 4.0's newer features for a documented,
stably reproducible Windows backend — a correctness/reproducibility choice, not a
feature chase.

**Consequences:** venv `sparkrl_env311` is the canonical interpreter (Day-1 `sparkrl_env`
kept for forensics); all 49 subsequent days run against this stack.

**Rollback path:** (a) revisit Spark 4.0.4 if a 3.4.x-native build emerges, re-gated by the
smoke matrix; (b) WSL2 Ubuntu + PySpark 3.5.x (same pip wheel) if native Windows ever
regresses; (c) Docker Spark image. All paths require re-passing the smoke matrix.

## DEC-008 | 2026-09-09 | Architecture candidate selection (Day 11)

**Selected architecture.** Candidate C — Hybrid offline-init + online adapt + cache
— selected for implementation (provisional, pending Day-12 contracts).
Full evaluation: `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_CANDIDATES.md`.

**Context.** PLAN §31 Day-11 task ("Architecture candidates | A/B/C vs 8
criteria (DEC) | criteria table"); frozen study (RQ0–RQ6, H1–H4, SC1–SC8,
EXP-001…EXP-012 + 005b) must be answerable unchanged on the DEC-007 backend
(single-node PySpark 3.5.9, ≤500 cached executions, 12 actions, AQE-off main).

**Candidates considered.** A: Offline surrogate (grid/BO → static config) —
measure first, deploy one static config, no online learning. B: Pure online
RL — cold-start ε-greedy tabular Q-learning from live executions only.
C: Hybrid — EXP-002 grid calibrates T_ref + pre-initializes Q, then bounded
(≤500) cached online adaptation. (A/B/C headers per PLAN §9 line 97.)

**Eight evaluation criteria (derived — PLAN names no eight explicitly; §5 of
the candidate doc cites the frozen source per criterion; unweighted 1–5 is a
Day-11 convention).** K1 RQ/EXP answerability (§5/§23) · K2 sample efficiency
under budget (§11/§23/§38) · K3 experimental control & reproducibility
(§22/§23/§33) · K4 adaptivity to drift (§2/§6) · K5 schedule/feasibility
(§31/§38–39, DEC-007) · K6 measurement validity (§7/§11/§20) · K7 risk &
Plan-B recoverability (§38–§39) · K8 AQE/baseline comparability (§7/§21–§23).

**Comparison summary (unweighted totals: A 27 · B 27 · C 38; C ≥4 on every
criterion).** A cannot answer RQ1–RQ4 (no policy/state/reward) and concedes
the study untested. B is most adaptive in principle but pays full live cost
per update, starts with uncalibrated T_ref, and has no graceful fallback.
C alone keeps every frozen EXP meaningful unchanged, enforces the ≤500
budget structurally via cache + guard, calibrates reward before learning,
and carries Plan B as a pre-designed operating point (grid + statics
reportable; 4-action/bandit shrink without rewrite).

**Rejected alternatives.** A — rejected: static output cannot test learning,
generalization, or ablations (EXP-004/006/007/008 void). B — rejected:
cold-start cost/variance unfair vs equal-budget baselines; failure strands
sunk RL plumbing with no artifact.

**Research implications.** None — RQs, Hx, SCs, EXPs, scope unchanged (drift
audit clean). EXP-002 becomes load-bearing (sensitivity proof + T_ref + init).

**Engineering implications.** Day-12 contracts must specify: Q-table
schema/init mapping, cache keys, v1.5 state vector, 12-action→SparkConf
table, R3 reward inputs, budget-guard/cache interplay, AQE control surface,
manifest/fingerprint formats, seed + test-set guard. Reuses Day-3
SparkConfig/session/runner/timing/baseline.

**Risks.** Gate fail (→ Plan-B benchmark, no rewrite) · cache
non-determinism (→ fingerprints/manifests/EXP-011) · reward misspecification
(→ R3 primary + A3–A5 ablations) · schedule (phased grid→env/agent→demo).

**Fallback.** Pre-authorized §39 tier 3: 12→4 actions, drop multi-step/LinUCB,
narrow ablations; grid + baseline evidence intact.

**Consequences.** Day 12 freezes component contracts/data flow for C only.
Substantive later changes need a new DEC entry (previous/new design, reason,
affected EXPs/docs, migration impact).

**Status.** DECIDED 2026-09-09 (provisional pending Day-12 freeze; NOT a claim
of empirical superiority — performance decided by EXP-004/005).

## Architecture change control (Day 11/12 freeze rule)

After the Day 11/12 architecture freeze, substantive architectural changes
require a new DECISIONS.md entry specifying previous design, new design,
reason, affected experiments (EXP-ids), affected documentation, and migration
impact. Editorial clarifications need only a commit message note.
